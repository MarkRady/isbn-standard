Laravel-based Book Query API using OpenLibrary and Docker
=========================================================

Introduction
------------

This project is a Laravel-based API designed for querying book information by ISBN numbers using the OpenLibrary API. It is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment, with Nginx and PHP-FPM as the main components of the tech stack.

Tech Stack
----------

*   **Laravel**: PHP web application framework for building the API.
*   **OpenLibrary API**: Provides book information, accessed using ISBN numbers.
*   **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
*   **Nginx**: High-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy.
*   **PHP-FPM**: FastCGI Process Manager for PHP.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone [repository-url]`
    
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd [project-directory]`
    
3.  **Build and Run Containers**
    
    *   This sets up Nginx and PHP containers.
    
    cssCopy code
    
    `docker-compose up --build`
    

Running the Application
-----------------------

The application is accessible via `http://localhost:8080` once the containers are up and running.

### Testing the API

Use the following `curl` command to test the book query functionality:

rustCopy code

`curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/book/9780712676090' \ --header 'Accept: application/json'`

Save to grepper

This requests the book information for the specified ISBN number.

Docker Compose Details
----------------------

The `docker-compose.yml` file configures the following services:

*   **nginx**: Serves the Laravel application.
*   **php**: PHP-FPM service for PHP requests.

Each service's Dockerfile specifies its environment, dependencies, and configurations.

Conclusion
----------

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Laravel-based API using Docker. Nginx and PHP-FPM ensure efficient web request handling and PHP processing, suitable for scalable deployments.
